 An event which indicates that a mouse action occurred in a component. This event is used both for mouse events (click, enter, exit) and mouse motion events (moves and drags).
This low-level event is generated by a component object for:

Mouse Events
a mouse button is pressed
a mouse button is released
a mouse button is clicked (pressed and released)
the mouse cursor enters a component
the mouse cursor exits a component
Mouse Motion Events
the mouse is moved
the mouse is dragged
A MouseEvent object is passed to every MouseListener or MouseAdapter object which registered to receive the "interesting" mouse events using the component's addMouseListener method. (MouseAdapter objects implement the MouseListener interface.) Each such listener object gets a MouseEvent containing the mouse event.

A MouseEvent object is also passed to every MouseMotionListener or MouseMotionAdapter object which registered to receive mouse motion events using the component's addMouseMotionListener method. (MouseMotionAdapter objects implement the MouseMotionListener interface.) Each such listener object gets a MouseEvent containing the mouse motion event.
